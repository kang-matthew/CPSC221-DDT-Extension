# Data-Driven Templates for CPSC 221

This extension provides templates for functions operating on popular data types used in CPSC 221. The use of templates provide type safety, so that you can better focus on finishing the function, and not worry too much about type safety problems; all while producing consistent code. 

## Features

There are multiple great features in using templates.
### HtDP-Style Templates

The template snippet set uses the style of data-driven templates used in HtDP or CPSC 110 @ UBC. The above image shows how a template for a singly linked-list can be shown in Racket and C++. 



> Tip: The template for C++ always provides parameters in Pass-By-Reference rather than Pass-By-Value. However, that part of the template is easily modifiable.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings
